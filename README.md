## 1. ‚ú® Personal Approach

My practice of foresight is grounded in a form of discernment that seeks not to dominate the future, but to inhabit it through **aesthetic desire**, **embodied ethics**, and **symbolic thought**‚Äîmy mother tongue, which I seek to expand into other languages.

The purpose is not to anticipate and thus capture scenarios of the future, but to **read and understand signs and patterns** I perceive, investigate, and study‚Äîwhat theology calls the ‚Äúsigns of the times‚Äù‚Äîin order to illuminate the intersections between becoming and the collective.

> The future is not predicted: **it is redeemed**. Whether we say we descend from God, from Mother Earth, or from universal elements‚Äîthis promise, understood by our ancestors, is a condition we are called to embody.

This is not a technical nor esoteric futurism; it is a **discernment in creation**, where each life inhabiting this world seeks presence and plenitude.

## 2.  Context of Origin

I come from a context where the development model has been successful for an elite and functional for a growing middle class‚Äîbut with widening socio-economic disparities. It was built on patterns of value concentration, extraction of natural resources as its genesis, and mass consumption detached from its vital meaning.

From Chile, I have observed how collective desire was diverted toward material emulation as a form of redemption‚Äîpostponing connections to land, to others, to the soul of the shared project. The economic ‚Äútrickle-down‚Äù worked partially, but at the cost of emotional disconnection and invisible fractures.

> Today, in a phase of material dispossession, I discover clarity from a different vantage point: more human, more integrated, more radically open to the mystery.

## 3.  Epistemological Framework

My approach stands at the intersection of several traditions:
- **üîç Futures Studies / Critical Futures Studies**: critical reading of the present to imagine possible futures.
- **üåø Epistemologies of the South**: valuing embodied, situated, ancestral, popular knowledge.
- **üîÑ Complex and Transdisciplinary Thought**: navigating levels of reality, integrating spiritual insight alongside rational thinking.
- **üåÄ Symbolic Philosophy & Embodied Spirituality**: understanding invisible patterns structuring the collective desire.
- **üå± Regeneration & Common Good**: advocating for an economy that nourishes rather than exhausts‚Äîwithout denying necessary growth.
- **ü§ñ AGI Alignment & Technology Philosophy**: insisting that AI must serve the soul, not just efficiency.

> This framework is not static. It is alive, in perpetual dialogue with mystery, history, and the concrete reality I inhabit.

## 4.  Prayer as Cognitive Praxis

> **Prayer is a precarious act‚Äînot because it is weak, but because it is done without guarantees. Because it arises from the radical humility of not controlling the mystery.**

In my praxis as a futurist, **prayer is not merely a devotional act**, but a form of **embodied epistemology**‚Äîa deep symbolic technology.

It is precarious because it does not command; yet powerful because it trusts.

Like ancient temples or profound natural silences‚Äîprayer connects me to a non-linear source of meaning, reminding me that **the future is not calculated, but first contemplated‚Ä¶ then embodied.**

## 5.  Secular Prayer of the Creator at the Threshold

I ask for no guarantees, no certainties.  
I open‚Äî with gratitude and humility‚Äî to the mystery.

**I am embodied prayer.**  
Not because I beg,  
but because I believe in a future I do not control,  
and to which I offer myself fully.

I renounce the illusion of control.  
I transcend my limiting beliefs.  
And in that surrender, I discover my soul is source,  
my vision is real,  
and my presence, a creating power.

Though fragile and without possession,  
though walking alone, in brokenness,  
**I am temple where the mystery dwells.**

From this threshold, I believe.  
From this prayer, I act.  
From this surrender, I redeem the promise.

##  Glosario Po√©tico de Sentido

###  Redemptive of the Promise

‚ÄúRedemptive‚Äù comes from Latin *redimere*‚Äîto rescue, liberate, redeem. At the heart of this spec, **to redeem the promise** is to update and embody what has been revealed to humanity as a sacred possibility‚Äîa fullness yearning to be awakened, a dignity longing to be freed, a future awaiting fruition.

- In the **Old Testament**, the promise is land, lineage, intimate bond with the divine‚Äîa covenant between human and transcendent.
- In the **New Testament**, that promise is fulfilled in Christ, who incarnates the way‚Äînot through imposition, but through redemption shaped by love, surrender, and radical trust.

To **redeem the promise** is therefore not an act of religion, but a stance that is simultaneously spiritual, political, and aesthetic:  
- It is recognizing that the future is not a prediction, but an embodied fulfillment.  
- It is seeing that the soul can dwell at a threshold where what was promised becomes present.  
- It is knowing that each life is a temple where the promise can be renewed.

Whether called God, Earth, destiny, vision, justice, or beauty‚Äîthe essence is that it calls us to act, to co-create, to dignify existence.

**Redeeming the promise is the mystical core of this Spec.**
